        <h2><b>GET TO KNOW US</b></h2>
        <h3><i>Our Background</i></h3>
        <blockquote>"The tranquility of flavorful and aromatic coffee, the nostalgic ambience brought NY homey and delectable pastry, and the marvel and majesty of literature itself, every element offers its own special narrative, and yet, they merge and collide together in harmony to create a wondrous haven that's open for any and all that's willing and curious to embrace the beauty of literature<br>let tranquility and euphoria grow within and forge a path towards various worlds and adventures only opened forth through the majestic doors of literature"</blockquote>
        <p>As an avid reader and certified chill enthusiast, I immediately associate the word paradise and haven with three distinctly tangible yet relatively mundane things: coffee, pastries, and most especially, books, books, and more books! To me, these are the ultimate tools for de-stressing and recharging amidst our ever-chaotic and endlessly busy lives. That is why, as an aspiring creator and innovator, I have decided to merge the things that I love into the creation my own little version of paradise catered to me and to all other people out there who love a good caffeine boost, has an undeniable sweet tooth, and is a certified bookworm, or all of the above! With Readers' Haven, you can enjoy coffees, pastries, and books; either solely or collectively. So what are you waiting for? Experience the tranquility brought about by our comforting brews and sweet treats, as well as the euphoria brought about by our majestic books, which you can either shop here at our store, online, or on-the-go!</p>
